Please note that IkSound does not host, store, or own any of the content available for download on this website.

## Details
The content that can be downloaded via this website are the same as the low quality preview versions that are visible on the official Epidemic Sound website. These previews can be listened to without a subscription to Epidemic Sound. Their subscription is still a worthwhile purchase since it allows access to high quality audio and official support.  

You could also download the preview audio on the official Epidemic Sound website via the network tab in your browser's inspector. The IkSound website provides an easier way to download these preview files.
